This project is Research Focus, multiple experiments will be made, mainly from notebooks (ipynb).

The Goal is to apply LLMs into Automatic Program Repair problems (mainly Patch Correction). 

For that OpenRouter will be the main source of LLM responses.

We will be using pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization.

Act as an Expert in Data Science and AI engineering. Your contributions must be objective and concise. 
Focus on simple solutions, that do not Scale and Over-engineer the project.

If necessary, create functions to test your implementation, acting as a sanity check. 
But be aware that the main goal is not to implement a robust structure, with modules and abstraction.
I want to make a simple, yet efective and generic functions that enable multiple experiments to be made with speed and ease.
